= Migrating Data from the Depricated filer-plugins to the new djangocms-*-plugins.

== It only works for

* cmsplugin_filer_file
* cmsplugin_filer_folder
* cmsplugin_filer_link
* cmsplugin_filer_image

== Usage

* Install djangocms-*-plugins.
* Install this script.
* Adjust this script as needed.
* Adjust your settings and templates for the new plugins as needed.
* Run this script by calling python3 manage.py migrate migration-app.
* Remove old plugins, configs and this script.

== Limitations

* This script does not migrate data for cmsplugin_filer_teaser.
* This script does not migrate data for cmsplugin_filer_video.
* Style and Templates are now merged.
  But this Script does not handel that.
  You need to adjust it depending on your usage.
* cmsplugin_filer_file always showed the size of a file.
  Now this is an option.
  Here we set it to the new default (to not show the size).
* It was possible to set a link to a file with the old cmsplugin_filer_link plugin.
  Thus migrating this requres djangocms-link and djangocms-file.
